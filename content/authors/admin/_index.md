My name is Yves Clément and I am a [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/) associate professor. I am working in the [Stem Cells, Development & Evolution](https://stemdevevo.wordpress.com/) group at [Institut Jacques Monod](https://www.ijm.fr/).

My reasearch topics are all realated to *evolutionary genomics*, studying how genomes evolved through time and function today, using a wide range of bioinformatic tools and a lot of data analysis.
You can find more information about my research topics (past and present) in the [Project](https://yvesclement.github.io/project_landing/) page.


If you'd like to work with us, feel free to [contact me](mailto:olivier.gimenez@cefe.cnrs.fr), and check out [this paper](/pubs/boulet-publi2012AnCons.pdf) which gives the spirit of how we enjoy doing science. For news and chat, you may find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oaggimenez), <a rel="me" href="https://bayes.club/@oaggimenez">Mastodon</a> and [GitHub](https://github.com/oliviergimenez) :smile:. When time allows, I write [R posts](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/) which are also published on [rweekly](https://rweekly.org) and [r-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/).
