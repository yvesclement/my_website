My name is Yves Clément and I am a [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/) associate professor. I am working in the [Stem Cells, Development & Evolution](https://stemdevevo.wordpress.com/) group at [Institut Jacques Monod](https://www.ijm.fr/).

My reasearch topics are all realated to *evolutionary genomics*, studying how genomes evolved through time and function today, using a wide range of bioinformatic tools and a lot of data analysis.
You can find more information about my research topics (past and present) in the [Project](https://yvesclement.github.io/project_landing/) page.
